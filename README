# tWIHEPFramework
tW code based on IHEP framework

SetUp Environment:
    source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_94/x86_64-slc6-gcc7-opt/setup.sh
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<FullPATH>/tWIHEPFramework/lib/

Compile:
    make clean
    make ttH

It produces an excutable bin/ttH/ttH\_generic.x

An example test program can be run using 'bash newTest.sh', which calls the program bin/ttH/ttH\_generic.cpp.

The framework is very modular and you can hopefully see in the ttH\_generic.cpp where the various cuts are added - there are then also a whole bunch of configuration files in the config/ directory that you can tune for your particular object/event selections.
The newTest.sh bash script is enough to run the code on a single file of the ttH MC as it stands.

Arguments I usally use in newTest.sh are as follows:
	  -config		 - Generic configuration file containing links to object defintions, cuts and dataset weights.
	  -inlist   	 - List of files to run over. In newTest.sh this is a single ttH file (for testing purposes)
	  -skimfile 	 - The output skim file after all cuts are applied. 
	  -mc	      	 - Tells the script that it's simulation. Leave off for data.
	  -UseTotalEvtFromFile 	 - This gets the number of MC events from a file (already saved in MCDatasets.info)
	  -MCatNLO		 - Tells the code to use MCatNLO weights.
	  -PileUpWgt	 - Read the pileup weight from the event tree
      -ReCalPU       - ReCalculate the Pileup Weight
      -lepSFs        - Apply lepSFs
      -bTagReShape   - ReShape b-tagging 
      -chargeMis     - Apply Flip Rate
      -Prefire       - Apply Prefire weight
      -FakeRate      - Apply FakeRate
      -TriggerSFs    - Apply TriggerSFs


Main modules:
    src/Base/EventContainer.cpp - Contains all the event objects
    src/Particles/Recon/        - Define reco objects
    src/Cuts/                   - All the event cuts
    src/Vars/                   - Add some additional variables

Submit Jobs for JES variations:
    utils/submitJobs/makeJobsForLegacyRegions.py are two scripts help submit condor jobs at IHEP 
    utils/submitJobs/resubmitJobs.py and utils/submitJobs/mergeCheck.py are two scripts to help collect failed jobs and resubmit 

    create and goes to new directory:
    cp utils/submitJobs/makeJobsForLegacyRegions.py .
    change baseDir to your tWIHEPFramework path
    loop over k from ["isSigExt"]
    loop over j from ["JESUp","JESDown"]
    select the JES source you want to run in Jecsources
    
    makeJobsForLegacyRegions.py will call utils/makeHEPSubitLegacyV2.py
    change frameworkDir in utils/makeHEPSubmitLegacyV2.py to your tWIHEPFramework path

    python makeJobsForLegacyRegions.py
    this should create script "all.sh"
    submit your jobs by bash all.sh
    
    once job are finished, use utils/submitJobs/resubmitJobs.py to check the job status and create failure jobs for resubmission 
    cp utils/submitJobs/resubmitJobs.py .
    change ignoredDirs for your purpose, directories in this list is not checked

    python resubmitJobs.py
    this should create a script "allmissingjob.sh" and printout the number of missing jobs
    bash allmissingjob.sh to resubmit the jobs

    A job is succussfully finished once this resubmitJobs.py script returns 0 missing jobs.
    
    The success rate should be > 99%.

    Notice: 
   
    one can only submit 20000 jobs, at the moment, run once three years simulation is 900 jobs.
    This means you can run run at most 10 jes source at time ( in total 11 sources )
    For this reason, you should change the Jecsources in makeJobsForLegacyRegions.py
